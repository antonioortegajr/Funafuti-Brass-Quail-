#Slide show thingy

Notes for myself later:
This is a meteor stack based on the simple-todos (with react) tutorial available at the meteor site.
https://www.meteor.com/tutorials/react/creating-an-app

Not completed I stopped this tut before checkboxes or users were created. As all I really needed was the react portion.

For the "slides" I just used canva because lazy.
